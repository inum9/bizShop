BizShop Backend Project Summary
Hello Chetan! This document summarizes the incredible progress we've made on your "BizShop" SaaS backend project. We've systematically built out the core functionalities, focusing on a modular architecture, robust error handling, and essential e-commerce features.

Project Overview
"BizShop" is a SaaS platform designed to allow users to create their own e-commerce websites. The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB (Mongoose), provides a comprehensive set of APIs to manage users, stores, products, orders, and subscriptions.

Features Implemented
We have successfully implemented the following essential features for your BizShop backend:

1. User Authentication & Authorization (Login & JWT)
User Registration (Signup): Allows new users to create accounts with secure password hashing (bcrypt).

User Login: Authenticates users and issues secure JSON Web Tokens (JWTs).

Access & Refresh Tokens: Implemented a robust token strategy for secure and persistent sessions. Access tokens are short-lived, while refresh tokens are used to obtain new access tokens.

Logout: Invalidates user sessions by clearing tokens from cookies and the database.

Route Protection (protect middleware): Ensures only authenticated users can access specific API endpoints.

Role-Based Access Control (restrictTo middleware): Restricts access to certain routes based on user roles (e.g., storeOwner, admin).

2. Store Management
Store Model: Defined a dedicated Store model to represent individual e-commerce websites, enabling multi-tenancy.

Store Creation: Allows authenticated storeOwner users to create their own e-commerce stores, linking the store to their user account.

Store Retrieval (My Store): Enables store owners to fetch details of their own store.

Store Update: Allows store owners to update their store's information.

Store Deactivation (Soft Delete): Provides a mechanism to logically deactivate a store.

3. Product Management
Product Model: Defined a Product model, linked to the Store model, to manage products within each e-commerce site.

Product Creation: Allows storeOwners to add new products to their store, including handling text-based product details. (Image handling was intentionally omitted as per your request for simplification).

Product Retrieval (All & Single): Enables store owners to list all products in their store and fetch details of a specific product.

Product Update: Allows store owners to modify existing product details.

Product Deletion: Enables store owners to remove products from their store.

4. Order Management
Order Model: Defined an Order model, including an embedded OrderItem schema for product details at the time of purchase, and linking to User (customer) and Store.

Order Creation: Allows authenticated users (customers) to place orders, including stock decrementing.

Customer Order History: Enables customers to view their own orders.

Store Order Management: Allows store owners to view all orders placed on their store.

Single Order Details: Provides detailed information for a specific order, with authorization checks for both customers and store owners.

Order Status Update: Enables store owners to update the status of orders (e.g., Processing, Shipped, Delivered) and manage payment/delivery flags.

5. Dashboard Statistics
Aggregated Metrics: Provides store owners with real-time insights into their business performance, including:

Total Sales (from paid orders)

Total Orders Count

Total Products Count

Total Distinct Customers

Recent Orders

Top Selling Products

6. Customers Page
Customer List for Store: Generates a list of distinct customers who have placed orders in a specific store, along with aggregated data like total orders placed, total sales, and last order date for each customer.

7. Settings Page (User Profile & Password Management)
User Profile Update: Allows authenticated users to update their personal details (name, email).

Password Update: Enables authenticated users to securely change their password, requiring the current password for verification.

8. Razorpay Integration (Partial - Payment Order & Webhooks)
Razorpay Client Setup: Configured the Razorpay SDK with API keys.

Payment Order Creation (processPlanSelection): Backend endpoint to create a Razorpay order, providing the necessary orderId, amount, currency, keyId, and user details for the frontend to initiate the Razorpay checkout.

Webhook Handling (handleRazorpayWebhook): Implemented a secure webhook endpoint to receive real-time payment confirmations from Razorpay. This is designed to update the user's subscriptionStatus and subscriptionExpiresAt upon successful payment.

9. Early Bird Feature
EarlyBirdConfig Model: Defined a model to store global Early Bird offer settings (max users, claimed users, offer type, duration).

Early Bird Status Retrieval: An endpoint to check the current availability and details of the Early Bird offer.

Plan Processing Logic (processPlanSelection): Integrated logic to:

Activate "Free" Early Bird plans directly.

Initiate Razorpay orders for "Discounted" Early Bird plans.

Manage the usersClaimed count and earlyBirdQuotaUsed flag.

Handle "Paid" plan selections by initiating Razorpay orders.

Conclusion
Chetan, you've successfully built a robust and feature-rich backend for "BizShop," covering all the essential requirements you outlined. This project demonstrates a strong understanding of Node.js, Express, MongoDB, authentication, authorization, multi-tenancy, and external API integrations.

This backend is now ready for you to connect a frontend application to, bringing your SaaS vision to life!
